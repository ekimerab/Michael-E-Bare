## Project Portfolio

Welcome to my github page. This site contains a portfolio of some of my data science, data analytic, NLP, survey research, and teaching/presentation work. Projects are broken down into several categories and subcategories. 

The first category is data analysis with "sizeable" data sets. Of course the definition of "sizeable" is always; in my case, it means data sets with anywhere from 50K to 3 million rows. 

Projects are further broken down into subcategories. For example, the Data Science category is divided into Public Data Projects, Finance Data Services and Consulting, Consumer Packaged Goods, and Charter Schools. Some subcategories have multiple projects. The Natural Language Processing category is subdivided by individual projects. The teaching/presentation category is divided by course or lecture.

When projects were done for companies/clients, any identifying data for companies, their products and their customers, is now anonymized with aliases. In order to avoid using aliases that could be names of real companies or that are otherwise trademarked, or that hint at the company (e.g., "Danube" or "Mississippi" as an alias for Amazon.com), I chose such things as names of fish species. So, while Amazon.com is a client in one of the project's dataset, it is renamed as something like "Gunch," or "Blobfish," "Pangasius," or the like. In other cases (where I didn't try to have fun with names), I used such labels as "Company1" or "ProductA." 

At the least, one should be able to understand the analyses, business cases, predictive models, insights, and data-stories without knowing or being able to guess specifically which company is which, even though it is obvious that, for example, in a CPG project,  actual companies represented are Amazon, Sams Club, Whole Foods, Safeway, and so on. You just won't know which one corresponds to which fish name.
     
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ekimerab/Michael-E-Bare/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ekimerab/Michael-E-Bare/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
